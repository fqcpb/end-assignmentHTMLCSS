# end-assignmentHTMLCSS
This is an webpage about cheese and wine, I made this for my end-assignment front-end developer, HTML and CSS module.
I included tables, columns, css, gradients, animation, dropdown menu, forms, navigation, grid, flexbox, responsive design, and a tiny bit of JavaScript.
I got an 9.7 for this. Most of the language used is Dutch.
